# ðŸ—³ Token Dashboard Submission

In order to list a new token on the [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance) and have it visible in our Dashboard please follow the steps below. If your token looks like a potential scam or we can't find reliable information about your project/company we reserve the right to avoid listing it on our visual Dashboard.

### 1. Fill out this Airtable Form

### 2. Issue Created

When you submit the Airtable form, it auto-generates a Github issue in our Token Assets repository. You can find the issues here:

* [https://github.com/superfluid-finance/assets/issues](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/assets/issues)

The Superfluid team will use the info from the issue to add the token to the Dashboard and to our protocol resolver. Hang tight!

### 3. Confirmation

The issue will be closed upon completion or rejection. Wait for a confirmation by the Superfluid team to the Discord handle you provided in the form before sharing publicly that your token is now live on Superfluid.

If you don't hear back from us within a week or need more information on the listing process please feel free to reach out via email at <mark style="color:blue;">support@superfluid.finance</mark> or reach out to us in the Support Channel of our [<mark style="color:blue;">Discord Server</mark>](http://discord.superfluid.finance/)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
